### Hibbins & Hahn (2022) Phylogenomic approaches to detecting and characterizing introgression

Abstract:
Phylogenomics has revealed the **remarkable frequency** with which **introgression** occurs across the tree of life. These discoveries have been **enabled by the rapid growth of methods designed to detect and characterize introgression from whole-genome sequencing data**. A large class of phylogenomic methods makes use of data across species to infer and characterize introgression **based on expectations from the multispecies coalescent**. These methods range from **simple tests**, such as the D-statistic, to **model-based approaches for inferring phylogenetic networks**. Here, we provide a detailed **overview of the various signals that different modes of introgression are expected leave** in the genome, and **how current methods are designed to detect them**. We discuss the strengths and pitfalls of these approaches and identify areas for future development, highlighting the different signals of introgression, and the power of each method to detect them. We conclude with a discussion of **current challenges in inferring introgression and how they could potentially be addressed**.

Biological processes that generate gene-tree heterogeneity
- ILS as a null hypothesis for tests of introgression
- Effects of introgression on gene trees

Detecting introgression using gene-tree frequencies
- The D-statistic to *detect* admixture
- Inferring the *extent and direction* of introgression (using derived allele counts)
- Inferring introgression from estimated gene trees

Detecting introgression using coalescence times
- *Detecting* introgression from signals of pairwise divergence
- *Characterising* introgression from gene trees with branch lengths
- Distinguishing introgression from ancestral population structure
- *Detecting* introgression between sister species (non-equilibrium demography, selection at linked sites)

Likelihood methods for detecting introgression

Challenges
- Phylogenetic uncertainty
- Introgression from unsampled ghost lineages
- Distinguishing among models of introgression
- Inferring the number of introgression events

## Athanasiadis et al. (2022) PNAS: A comprehensive map of genetic relationships among diagnostic categories based on 48.6 million relative pairs from the Danish genealogy

Abstract:
For more than half a century, **Denmark** has maintained **population-wide demographic, health care, and socioeconomic registers** that provide detailed information on the interaction between all residents and the extensive national social services system. We **leverage this resource to reconstruct the genealogy of the entire nation based on all individuals legally residing in Denmark since 1968**. We **cross-reference 6,691,426 individuals with nationwide health care registers to estimate heritability and genetic correlations of 10 broad diagnostic categories involving all major organs and systems**. **Heritability** estimates for **mental disorders were consistently the highest across demographic cohorts** (average h2 = 0.406, 95% CI = [0.403, 0.408]), whereas estimates for **cancers were the lowest** (average h2 = 0.130, 95% CI = [0.125, 0.134]). The average **genetic correlation** of each of the 10 diagnostic categories with the other nine was highest for gastrointestinal conditions (average rg = 0.567, 95% CI = [0.566, 0.567]) and lowest for urogenital conditions (average rg = 0.386, 95% CI = [0.385, 0.388]). Mental, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological conditions had similar genetic correlation profiles.

Significance:
The ability to extract multigenerational family relationships from large-scale population cohorts provides a powerful means to understand the heritability of a wide range of diseases and their genetic relationships to each other. By showing how the heritability of broad diagnostic categories changes over time and how said categories are related on the genetic level, our analysis of the Danish genealogy and linked national patient registers illustrates the vast **potential of this resource in current biomedical research**.

## Pollack & Cobb (2022) PNAS: Are there any good experiments that should not be done?

Final sentences: "In each of these examples, a case can be made that the real risks far outweigh the potential benefits and that these kinds of experiments should not be performed, either through self-restraint or via a global legal framework. Researchers need to take responsibility for the consequences of their science. Fifty years on, the question remains: Are there any good experiments we should not do?"
