## Picks summary

### Slatkin (2022) Genetics
A **composite likelihood method** is introduced for **jointly estimating the intensity of selection and the rate of mutation**, both scaled by the effective population size, when there is **balancing selection at a single multi-allelic locus in an isolated population at demographic equilibrium**. The performance of the method is tested using simulated data. Average estimated mutation rates and selection intensities are close to the true values but there is considerable variation about the averages. **Allowing for both population growth and population subdivision** does not result in qualitative differences but the **estimated mutation rates and selection intensities do not in general reflect the current effective population size**. The method is **applied to 3 class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and 2 class II loci (HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1) in the 1000 Genomes populations**. Allowing for asymmetric balancing selection has only a slight effect on the results from the symmetric model. **Mutations that restore symmetry of the selection model are preferentially retained because of the tendency of natural selection to maximize average fitness**. However, slight differences in selective effects result in much longer persistence time of some alleles. **Trans-species polymorphism, which is characteristic of major-histocompatibility loci in vertebrates, is more likely when there are small differences in allelic fitness than when complete symmetry is assumed**. Therefore, variation in allelic fitness expands the range of parameter values consistent with observations of trans-species polymorphism.


### Rivollat et al. (2022) PNAS
Significance
By **integrating genomic and archaeological data**, we provide new insights into the **Neolithic French monumental site of Fleury-sur-Orne in Normandy**, where a group of selected individuals was buried in impressively long monuments. The earliest individuals buried at Fleury-sur-Orne **match the expected western European Neolithic genetic diversity**, while three individuals, designated as genetic **outliers, were buried after 4,000 calibrated BCE**. We hypothesize that different, unrelated families or clans used the site over several centuries. Thirteen of 14 of the analyzed individuals were male, indicating an **overarching patrilineal system**. However, one exception, a female buried with a symbolically male artifact, suggests that the embodiment of the male gender in death was required to access burial at the monumental structures.

Abstract
The Middle Neolithic in western Europe is characterized by monumental funerary structures, known as megaliths, along the Atlantic façade. The first manifestations of this phenomenon occurred in modern-day France with the long mounds of the Cerny culture. Here, we present genome-wide data from the fifth-millennium BCE site of Fleury-sur-Orne in Normandy (France), famous for its impressively long monuments built for selected individuals. The site encompasses 32 monuments of variable sizes, containing the burials of 19 individuals from the Neolithic period. To address who was buried at the site, we generated genome-wide data for 14 individuals, of whom 13 are males, completing previously published data [M. Rivollat et al., Sci. Adv. 6, eaaz5344 (2020)]. Population genetic and Y chromosome analyses show that the Fleury-sur-Orne group fits within western European Neolithic genetic diversity and that the arrival of a new group is detected after 4,000 calibrated BCE. The results of analyzing uniparentally inherited markers and an **overall low number of long runs of homozygosity suggest a patrilineal group practicing female exogamy**. We find two pairs of individuals to be father and son, buried together in the same monument/grave. No other biological relationship can link monuments together, suggesting that each monument was dedicated to a genetically independent lineage. The combined data and documented father–son line of descent suggest a male-mediated transmission of sociopolitical authority. However, a single female buried with an arrowhead, otherwise considered a symbol of power of the male elite of the Cerny culture, questions a strictly biological sex bias in the burial rites of this otherwise “masculine” monumental cemetery.

### Wu et al. (2022) PNAS
Significance
**Antagonistic pleiotropy (AP)** is a prevailing **theory of the evolution of aging**; however, it lacks direct experimental evidence at an individual gene level. We performed unbiased **translatome analyses of *Caenorhabditis elegans* recovering from starvation** and identified that the **trl-1 gene hidden in a pseudogene generates proteinaceous products upon refeeding**. Compared with wild-type animals, trl-1 **mutants increased brood sizes, shortened the animals’ lifespan, and specifically impaired germline deficiency–induced longevity**. The TRL-1 protein undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation, through which TRL-1 granules recruit vitellogenin messenger RNA and inhibit its translation. These results provide **evidence that trl-1 regulates the reproduction–longevity tradeoff by optimizing nutrient production for the next generation**, thereby supporting the AP theory of aging at the single-gene level.

Abstract
The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging proposes that genes enhancing fitness in early life limit the lifespan, but the molecular evidence remains underexplored. By profiling translatome changes in Caenorhabditis elegans during starvation recovery, we find that an open reading frame (ORF) trl-1 “hidden” within an annotated pseudogene significantly translates upon refeeding. trl-1 mutant animals increase brood sizes but shorten the lifespan and specifically impair germline deficiency–induced longevity. The loss of trl-1 abnormally up-regulates the translation of vitellogenin that produces copious yolk to provision eggs, whereas vitellogenin overexpression is known to reduce the lifespan. We show that the TRL-1 protein undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), through which TRL-1 granules recruit vitellogenin messenger RNA and inhibit its translation. These results indicate that trl-1 functions as an antagonistic pleiotropic gene to regulate the reproduction–longevity tradeoff by optimizing nutrient production for the next generation.
