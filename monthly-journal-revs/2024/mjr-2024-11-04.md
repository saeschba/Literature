## Picks by others

### Iris (since July)
Biological Conservation
- Inbreeding depression

Conservation Biology
- Adaptation and translocation: test of adaptation after translocation. Translocated individuals might have lower fitness; evidence is population genomic.
- Best-practice review: plant translocations – what factors make translocations successful?
- Books: hunting effects in the tropics and subtropics; trophy hunting

Heredity
- Inbreeding depression in white-tailed deer

Evolutionary Applications
- Effective population size
- **Epigenetic diversity and potential of natural populations**
- **Genetic rescue**
- Alpine ibex
- Estimating effective size in European wolf populations: number of packs as a good proxy of $N_e$.
- Genomic diversity as a good predictor of a conservation status

### Lova
Evolution
- Phenotypic plasticity as enabling subsequent genetic local adaptation in raddish weed. Do flexible traits help to adapt to farms. Similar changes across different environments.
- Social selection analysis: limited effect of ... in tree swallow birds; social interactions with other birds affecting reproductive behaviour.
- Adaptation and long-term persistance across range limits. Evidence pointing to preadaptation, not rapid recent adaptation.

...
- Macro-invertebrate diversity; degraded system appeared healthy despite shift in community composition; sensitive species were replaced by generalist species; biodiversity did not change overall; needs for better resolved biodiversity indices who account for functional diversity

### Daniela

BMC Evolution and Ecology
- Cuticular hydrocarbon profile: adaptive trait or not? It varies more between functions within species than between species.

### Vera
G3
- OneSamp v3: Estimation of Ne via SNPs from a single population. Based on ABC. Performs well or better compared to existing tools. Uses LD and multilocus statistics.
