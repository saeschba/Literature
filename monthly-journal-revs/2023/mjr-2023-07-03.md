# Summary of Picks

### Xiao et al. (2023) PNAS: Adaptive and maladaptive introgression in grapevine domestication
- domesticated grapevines spread to Europe around 3,000 years ago
- time, mode, genomic pattern, and biological effects of these introgression events have not been investigated
- history of introgression between domesticated grapes and their European wild relative
- resequencing data from 345 samples spanning the distributional range of wild (Vitis vinifera ssp. sylvestris) and cultivated (V. vinifera ssp. vinifera) grapes
- machine learning–based population genetic analyses (scan for introgression [population branch statistic] and sweeps [shic])
- single domestication of grapevine with introgression from the wild relative to wine, but not to table, grapes: single domestication of grapevine, followed by continuous gene flow between European wild grapes (EU) and cultivated grapes over the past ~2,000 y, especially from EU to wine grapes
- regions are enriched for genes related to aromatic compound synthesis, suggesting that European wild grapes have been an important resource for improving the flavor of wine grapes
- beneficial effects of introgression carry a potential cost because introgressed regions have elevated numbers of putatively deleterious variants, which are usually maintained in a heterozygous state for this clonally propagated crop

### Duthé et al. (2023) PNAS: Reductions in home-range size and social interactions among dehorned black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis)
- illegal trade and tusks and horns --> decline of megaherbivores including the African black rhinoceros
- large-scale removal and trimming of rhinoceros horns by conservationists (preventive)
- reduction in poaching-induced mortality, but now also finding that preventive measure is affecting black rhino space use and interactions
- 10 South African reserves: black rhinos reduced home ranges and social encounters
- change in behavioural ecology might have demographic consequences (yet to be determined)
- important to consider behavioural response to conservation interventions when planning these

### Ye et al. (2023) PNAS: Twins, income, and happiness: Evidence from China
- fundamental question in economic, psychological, and social science: whether and hoch much income truly brings happiness
- study on identical Chinese twins, thus correcting for unobserved genetic factors that might impact income and happiness
- address measurement bias and robustness checks
- find an effect of income on happiness much larger than previous estimates: doubling the income boosts the four-scale happiness value by 0.26 scales (or 0.37 SDs)
- heterogeneity analyses: income matters most for males and the middle-aged
- emphasises the importance of income maintenance for individuals' well-being
