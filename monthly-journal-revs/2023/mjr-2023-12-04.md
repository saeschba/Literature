## Swinford et al. and B. M. Henn (2023) PNAS: Increased homozygosity due to endogamy results in fitness consequences in a human population

**Significance**
Human populations have been shown to differ in their **mutation load**—the accumulation of mutations in their genomes; the penetrance of these mutations will depend on their recessive, dominant, or additive states. However, **most estimates of mutation load are theoretical and have not been associated with evolutionary fitness (i.e., reproductive success)**. Here, we assess the **effect of runs of homozygosity on fitness in a natural fertility population from northern Namibia**. **As the homozygous fraction of the genome increases, female fertility is significantly reduced**. This suggests a **multilocus genetic effect on fitness driven by the expression of deleterious recessive alleles**. Interestingly, despite a cultural preference for consanguineous marriage in the Himba, we find that **such marriages rarely occur between close biological kin**.

**Abstract**
**Recessive alleles** have been shown to directly affect both **human Mendelian disease phenotypes and complex traits**. **Pedigree studies** also suggest that **consanguinity** results in increased childhood mortality and adverse health phenotypes, presumably through **penetrance of recessive mutations**. Here, we test whether the accumulation of homozygous, **recessive alleles decreases reproductive success in a human population**. We address this question among the **Namibian Himba**, an **endogamous agro-pastoralist population, who until very recently practiced natural fertility**. Using a sample of 681 individuals, we show that Himba exhibit **elevated levels of “inbreeding,” calculated as the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (FROH)**. Many individuals contain multiple long segments of ROH in their genomes, indicating that their parents had high kinship coefficients. However, we do not find evidence that this is explained by first-cousin consanguinity, despite a reported social preference for cross-cousin marriages. Rather, we show that elevated haplotype sharing in the Himba is **due to a bottleneck, likely in the past 60 generations**. We test **whether increased recessive mutation load** results in **observed fitness consequences** by assessing the effect of FROH on completed fertility in a cohort of **postreproductive women** (n = 69). We find that **higher FROH is significantly associated with lower fertility**. Our data suggest a multilocus genetic effect on fitness driven by the **expression of deleterious recessive alleles**, especially those in long ROH. However, these effects are not the result of consanguinity but rather **elevated background identity by descent**.

## Wong et al. (2023) PNAS: On the roles of function and selection in evolving systems

**Significance**
The universe is replete with complex evolving systems, but the existing macroscopic physical laws do not seem to adequately describe these systems. Recognizing that the identification of **conceptual equivalencies** among disparate phenomena were foundational to developing previous laws of nature, **we approach a potential “missing law” by looking for equivalencies among evolving systems**. We suggest that all evolving systems—including but not limited to life—are **composed of diverse components that can combine into configurational states that are then selected for or against based on function**. We then identify the fundamental sources of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—and propose a **time-asymmetric law that states that the functional information of a system will increase over time when subjected to selection for function(s)**.

**Abstract**
Physical laws—such as the laws of motion, gravity, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics—codify the general behavior of varied macroscopic natural systems across space and time. We propose that an additional, hitherto-unarticulated law is required to characterize familiar macroscopic phenomena of our complex, evolving universe. An important feature of the classical laws of physics is the conceptual equivalence of specific characteristics shared by an extensive, seemingly diverse body of natural phenomena. Identifying potential equivalencies among disparate phenomena—for example, falling apples and orbiting moons or hot objects and compressed springs—has been instrumental in advancing the scientific understanding of our world through the articulation of laws of nature. A pervasive wonder of the natural world is the evolution of varied systems, including stars, minerals, atmospheres, and life. These evolving systems appear to be conceptually equivalent in that they display three **notable attributes**: 1) They form from numerous components that have the potential to adopt **combinatorially vast numbers of different configurations**; 2) processes exist that generate numerous **different** configurations; and 3) configurations are preferentially **selected based on function**. We identify universal concepts of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—that underpin function and drive systems to evolve through the exchange of information between the environment and the system. Accordingly, we propose a **“law of increasing functional information”: The functional information of a system will increase (i.e., the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system undergo selection for one or more functions**.

## Shpak et al. (2023) PLoS Biol.: Genomes from historical Drosophila melanogaster specimens illuminate adaptive and demographic changes across more than 200 years of evolution

The ability to perform genomic sequencing on long-dead organisms is opening new frontiers in evolutionary research. These opportunities are especially notable in the case of **museum collections**, from which countless documented specimens may now be suitable for genomic analysis—if data of sufficient quality can be obtained. Here, we report **25 newly sequenced genomes from museum specimens of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including the oldest extant specimens of this species**. By comparing historical samples ranging from the early **1800s to 1933 against modern-day genomes**, we document evolution across thousands of generations, including time periods that encompass the **species’ initial occupation of northern Europe and an era of rapidly increasing human activity**. We also find that **the Lund, Sweden population underwent local genetic differentiation during the early 1800s to 1933 interval (potentially due to drift in a small population) but then became more similar to other European populations thereafter (potentially due to increased migration)**. Within each century-scale time period, our temporal sampling allows us to document **compelling candidates for recent natural selection**. In some cases, we gain insights regarding previously implicated selection candidates, such as **ChKov1**, for which our inferred **timing of selection favors the hypothesis of antiviral resistance over insecticide resistance**. **Other candidates are novel, such as the circadian-related gene Ahcy**, which yields a selection signal that rivals that of the DDT resistance gene Cyp6g1. These insights deepen our understanding of recent evolution in a model system, and highlight the potential of future museomic studies.

## Kiermer (2023) Authorship practices must evolve to support collaboration and open science

Journal authorship practices have not sufficiently evolved to reflect the way research is now done. Improvements to support teams, collaboration, and open science are urgently needed.
