# Summary of Picks

## Wakeley et al. (2023) Genetics: Recurrent mutation in the ancestry of a rare variant

Abstract
**Recurrent mutation** produces multiple copies of the same allele which may be co-segregating in a population. Yet most **analyses of allele-frequency or site-frequency spectra assume that all observed copies of an allele trace back to a single mutation**. We develop a **sampling theory for the number of latent mutations in the ancestry of a rare variant**, specifically a variant observed in relatively small count in a large sample. Our results follow from the **statistical independence of low-count mutations**, which we show to hold for the standard neutral coalescent or diffusion model of population genetics as well as for more general coalescent trees. For **populations of constant size**, these counts are **distributed like the number of alleles in the Ewens sampling formula**. We develop a **Poisson sampling model** **for populations of varying size**, and illustrate it using new results for site-frequency spectra in an exponentially growing population. We **apply our model to a large data set of human SNPs and use it to explain dramatic differences in site-frequency spectra across the range of mutation rates in the human genome**.

## Li and Barton (2023) Genetics: Estimating linkage disequilibrium and selection from allele frequency trajectories

Abstract
**Genetic sequences collected over time** provide an exciting opportunity to **study natural selection**. In such studies, it is important to **account for linkage disequilibrium** to accurately measure selection and **to distinguish between selection and** other effects that can cause changes in allele frequencies, such as **genetic hitchhiking or clonal interference**. However, most high-throughput sequencing methods cannot directly measure linkage due to short-read lengths. Here we **develop a simple method to estimate linkage disequilibrium from time-series allele frequencies**. This reconstructed linkage information can then be **combined with other inference methods to infer the fitness effects of individual mutations**. Simulations show that our approach reliably **outperforms inference that ignores linkage disequilibrium** and, with sufficient sampling, performs similarly to inference using the true linkage information. We also introduce two regularization methods derived from random matrix theory that help to preserve its performance under limited sampling effects. Overall, **our method enables the use of linkage-aware inference methods even for data sets where only allele frequency time series are available**.

## Lotterhos (2023) PNAS: The paradox of adaptive trait clines with nonclinal patterns in the underlying genes

Significance
Population geneticists have historically modeled **adaptation in meta-populations to a single environmental gradient**, which **evolves monotonic clinal patterns in allele frequency at the loci under selection**. This study shows that **under complex multivariate adaptation, trait clines can evolve despite nonmonotonic allele frequency patterns across environmental gradients**. These **patterns are not discovered by genotype–environment association methods**, which are widely used to discover adaptation. This result **challenges widely held conceptual models of adaptation via subtle shifts in allele frequencies across environmental gradients and can explain why genes that underlie environmental traits do not always evolve clines**. Additionally, this study shows that even when inference from genotype–environment association methods is inaccurate, multivariate quantitative traits can still be accurately estimated from genotypes and environments.

Abstract
Multivariate climate change presents an urgent need to understand **how species adapt to complex environments**. Population genetic theory predicts that loci under selection will form **monotonic allele frequency clines with their selective environment**, which has led to the wide use of **genotype–environment associations (GEAs)**. This study used a set of **simulations to elucidate the conditions under which allele frequency clines are more or less likely to evolve as multiple quantitative traits adapt to multivariate environments**. Phenotypic clines evolved with **nonmonotonic (i.e., nonclinal) patterns in allele frequencies** under conditions that promoted **unique combinations of mutations to achieve the multivariate optimum in different parts of the landscape**. Such conditions resulted from **interactions among landscape, demography, pleiotropy, and genetic architecture**. **GEA methods failed to accurately infer the genetic basis of adaptation** under a range of scenarios due to first principles (**clinal patterns did not evolve**) or statistical issues (clinal patterns evolved but were not detected due to **overcorrection for structure**). Despite the limitations of GEAs, this study shows that **a back-transformation of multivariate ordination (redundancy analysis) can accurately predict individual multivariate traits from genotype and environmental data regardless of whether inference from GEAs was accurate**. In addition, **frameworks are introduced that can be used by empiricists to quantify the importance of clinal alleles in adaptation**. This research highlights that **multivariate trait prediction from genotype and environmental data** can lead to **accurate inference** regardless of whether the underlying loci display clinal or nonmonotonic patterns.

## Soriano-Redondo et al. (2023) PNAS: Demographic rates reveal the benefits of protected areas in a long-lived migratory bird

Significance
The **conservation** of the natural world currently relies on the **establishment of protected areas**. However, **site protection** alone does **not guarantee good biodiversity outcomes**. Here, we take advantage of a **30-y dataset on Whooper swans which provides a rare opportunity to quantify the role of nature reserves in the population dynamics of a migratory waterbird**. We find that nature reserves play a key role by boosting the survival of this species and will effectively double its population size by 2030.

Abstract
Recent studies have suggested that **protected areas often fail to conserve target species**. However, the **efficacy of terrestrial protected areas is difficult to measure, especially for highly vagile species like migratory birds** that may move between protected and unprotected areas throughout their lives. Here, we use a **30-y dataset of detailed demographic data** from a migratory waterbird, the **Whooper swan** (Cygnus cygnus), to assess the value of nature reserves (NRs). We assess **how demographic rates vary at sites with varying levels of protection and how they are influenced by movements between sites**. Swans had a **lower breeding probability when wintering inside NRs than outside but better survival for all age classes**, generating a **30-fold higher annual growth rate within NRs**. There was also a **net movement of individuals from NRs to non-NRs**. By combining these demographic rates and estimates of movement (into and out of NRs) into population projection models, we show that the **NRs should help to double the population of swans wintering in the United Kingdom by 2030**. These results highlight the **major effect that spatial management can have on species conservation, even when the areas protected are relatively small and only used during short periods of the life cycle**.
