# Summary of Picks

## Zeitler et al. (2023) in PLoS Genetics: Purging due to self-fertilization does not prevent accumulation of expansion load

Abstract:
As species expand their geographic ranges, colonizing populations face novel ecological conditions, such as new environments and limited mates, and suffer from evolutionary consequences of demographic change through bottlenecks and mutation load accumulation. Self-fertilization is often observed at species range edges and, in addition to countering the lack of mates, is hypothesized as an evolutionary advantage against load accumulation through increased homozygosity and purging. We study how selfing impacts the accumulation of genetic load during range expansion via purging and/or speed of colonization. Using simulations, we disentangle inbreeding effects due to demography versus due to selfing and find that selfers expand faster, but still accumulate load, regardless of mating system. The severity of variants contributing to this load, however, differs across mating system: higher selfing rates purge large-effect recessive variants leaving a burden of smaller-effect alleles. We compare these predictions to the mixed-mating plant Arabis alpina, using whole-genome sequences from refugial outcrossing populations versus expanded selfing populations. Empirical results indicate accumulation of expansion load along with evidence of purging in selfing populations, concordant with our simulations, suggesting that while purging is a benefit of selfing evolving during range expansions, it is not sufficient to prevent load accumulation due to range expansion.

Summary:
The geographic space that species occupy, i.e., the species range, is known to fluctuate over time due to changing environmental conditions. Since the most recent glaciation, many species have recolonized available habitat as the ice sheets melted, expanding their range. When populations at species range margins expand into newly available space, they suffer from an accumulation of deleterious alleles due to repeated founder effects. We study whether self-fertilization, which is considered an evolutionary dead-end, can be favored under these expanding edge conditions. Selfing has two important effects: allowing for faster expansion due to reproductive assurance and purging recessive deleterious alleles by exposing them to selection as homozygotes. We use simulations to identify the impact of selfing on expanded populations and then compare these results to an empirical dataset to assess whether our predictions are met. We use the mixed-mating plant alpine rock-cress (Arabis alpina) since it has both expanded since the last glaciation and undergone a mating shift to selfing. We find that selfing does not prevent the accumulation of deleterious load, however purging does still act to remove the most severe variants, indicating that selfing provides this benefit during range expansions.

## Charlesworth (2023) in Genetics: The effects of inversion polymorphisms on patterns of neutral genetic diversity

Abstract:
The strong reduction in the frequency of recombination in heterozygotes for an inversion and a standard gene arrangement causes the arrangements to become partially isolated genetically, resulting in sequence divergence between them and changes in the levels of neutral variability at nucleotide sites within each arrangement class. Previous theoretical studies on the effects of inversions on neutral variability have assumed either that the population is panmictic or that it is divided into 2 populations subject to divergent selection. Here, the theory is extended to a model of an arbitrary number of demes connected by migration, using a finite island model with the inversion present at the same frequency in all demes. Recursion relations for mean pairwise coalescent times are used to obtain simple approximate expressions for diversity and divergence statistics for an inversion polymorphism at equilibrium under recombination and drift, and for the approach to equilibrium following the sweep of an inversion to a stable intermediate frequency. The effects of an inversion polymorphism on patterns of linkage disequilibrium are also examined. The reduction in effective recombination rate caused by population subdivision can have significant effects on these statistics. The theoretical results are discussed in relation to population genomic data on inversion polymorphisms, with an emphasis on Drosophila melanogaster. Methods are proposed for testing whether or not inversions are close to recombination–drift equilibrium, and for estimating the rate of recombinational exchange in heterozygotes for inversions; difficulties involved in estimating the ages of inversions are also discussed.

Conclusions:
The theoretical results described here provide pointers on how to interpret population genomic data on inversion polymorphisms, with caveats about methods for estimating the ages of inversions. They are subject to several important limitations. In particular, they are based on expectations for pairwise coalescence times. A study of the variances of pairwise diversity and divergence statistics suggests that averages taken over the many thousands of sites in the central regions of several megabase inversions that are several megabases in size have high statistical precision (see sections 8 and 9 of Supplementary File 1), but a rigorous statistical framework such as maximum likelihood inference based on the structured coalescent process (e.g. Lohse et al. 2011) remains to be developed. In addition, many simplifying assumptions have been made, including ignoring the consequences of selection on loci responsible for maintaining the inversion polymorphisms, as well as the effects of Hill–Robertson interference in the low recombination environment characteristic of low-frequency inversions. There is, therefore, plenty of scope for further work.

## Ballinger et al. (2023) in PNAS: Environmentally robust *cis*-regulatory changes underlie rapid climatic adaptation

Significance:
Gene expression variation is shaped by both genetic and environmental effects, yet these two factors are rarely considered together in the context of adaptive evolution. We studied environmental influences on gene regulatory evolution in temperate and tropical house mice in cold and warm laboratory environments. We found that genetic effects in the form of cis-regulatory divergence were pervasive and largely insensitive to the environment. Many of these genetic effects are under selection and are associated with genes that affect body size, suggesting cis-regulatory changes as a possible mechanism for adaptive body size evolution. We also found many trans-effects controlling expression plasticity, demonstrating the importance of both genetic and nongenetic changes associated with adaptation over short timescales (a few hundred generations).

Abstract:
Changes in gene expression are thought to play a major role in adaptive evolution. While it is known that gene expression is highly sensitive to the environment, very few studies have determined the influence of genetic and environmental effects on adaptive gene expression differences in natural populations. Here, we utilize allele-specific expression to characterize cis and trans gene regulatory divergence in temperate and tropical house mice in two metabolic tissues under two thermal conditions. First, we show that gene expression divergence is pervasive between populations and across thermal conditions, with roughly 5 to 10% of genes exhibiting genotype-by-environment interactions. Second, we found that most expression divergence was due to cis-regulatory changes that were stable across temperatures. In contrast, patterns of expression plasticity were largely attributable to trans-effects, which showed greater sensitivity to temperature. Nonetheless, we found a small subset of temperature-dependent cis-regulatory changes, thereby identifying loci underlying expression plasticity. Finally, we performed scans for selection in wild house mice to identify genomic signatures of rapid adaptation. Genomic outliers were enriched in genes with evidence for cis-regulatory divergence. Notably, these genes were associated with phenotypes that affected body weight and metabolism, suggesting that cis-regulatory changes are a possible mechanism for adaptive body size evolution between populations. Our results show that gene expression plasticity, largely controlled in trans, may facilitate the colonization of new environments, but that evolved changes in gene expression are largely controlled in cis, illustrating the genetic and nongenetic mechanisms underlying the establishment of populations in new environments.

## Severin et al. (2023) in PLoS Biology: Relationship between journal impact factor and the thoroughness and helpfulness of peer reviews

Abstract:
The Journal Impact Factor is often used as a proxy measure for journal quality, but the empirical evidence is scarce. In particular, it is unclear how peer review characteristics for a journal relate to its impact factor. We analysed 10,000 peer review reports submitted to 1,644 biomedical journals with impact factors ranging from 0.21 to 74.7. Two researchers hand-coded sentences using categories of content related to the thoroughness of the review (Materials and Methods, Presentation and Reporting, Results and Discussion, Importance and Relevance) and helpfulness (Suggestion and Solution, Examples, Praise, Criticism). We fine-tuned and validated transformer machine learning language models to classify sentences. We then examined the association between the number and percentage of sentences addressing different content categories and 10 groups defined by the Journal Impact Factor. The median length of reviews increased with higher impact factor, from 185 words (group 1) to 387 words (group 10). The percentage of sentences addressing Materials and Methods was greater in the highest Journal Impact Factor journals than in the lowest Journal Impact Factor group. The results for Presentation and Reporting went in the opposite direction, with the highest Journal Impact Factor journals giving less emphasis to such content. For helpfulness, reviews for higher impact factor journals devoted relatively less attention to Suggestion and Solution than lower impact factor journals. In conclusion, peer review in journals with higher impact factors tends to be more thorough, particularly in addressing study methods while giving relatively less emphasis to presentation or suggesting solutions. Differences were modest and variability high, indicating that the Journal Impact Factor is a bad predictor of the quality of peer review of an individual manuscript.

## Bradke et al. (2023) in PLoS Biology: Key attributes of successful research institutes

Abstract:
Science does not take place in a vacuum: The physical and social workplace has a profound influence on scientific discoveries. Everyone at a research institute can contribute to its scientific output and productivity, from faculty research groups to facilities and platforms staff to administration and corporate services. Although the researchers addressing exciting scientific questions are key, their efforts can be fostered and directed by the overarching strategy of the institute, interconnection with facilities and platforms, and strong and directed support of the administration and corporate services. Everybody counts and everybody should be empowered to contribute. But what are the characteristics that make scientific organizations and their people flourish? This Essay looks at the structure and culture of successful research institutes, laying out different operational strategies and highlighting points that need be taken into consideration during their implementation.
