# Review of Manuscript MBE-22-0354.R1 by Huang et al. "Inference of gene flow between species under misspecified models"

## Instructions by Mol. Biol. Evol. fir Articles
Articles are original reports of significant discoveries, **methods**, and resources. Articles may present novel and important empirical results, theories that have the potential to advance our understanding of molecular evolution, or **statistical, computational, or experimental methods**. Articles based primarily on empirical results need to be more than confirmatory, and must provide data that advance the field of evolutionary biology. Theoretical and methodological reports need to **clearly demonstrate the robustness and practical utility of the advanced methods using computer simulations and example data analysis**. MBE also welcomes articles presenting the accuracy and comparative effectiveness of existing methods and algorithms, which should also include guidelines for selecting methods in practical data analysis.

Articles may describe significant advances in widely-used software tools, databases, and experimental protocols that currently serve as critical enabling technologies for molecular evolutionary studies. Articles must clearly describe how the advances will broaden the application scope or significantly accelerate the pace of biological discovery. MBE also welcomes articles describing new resources that have broad applicability and clear potential to become widely used. Authors of resource articles that describe incremental, but highly impactful advances should consider submitting them as Brief Communications. All research resources must be made available for general usage at the time of publication.

Format: Articles have an **abstract of up to 250 words**. This is followed by sections (in order) with headings: Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Materials and Methods. Results and Discussion may be combined. Subsections are allowed throughout. For articles describing new or improved methods and resources, authors should add a section entitled New Approaches after the Introduction. This section should clearly and succinctly present the new or improved methods or approaches, with extensive details provided in the Materials and Methods section, if necessary (See General Author Guidelines for all other information on manuscript preparation).

## Summary
Huang and co-authors address the effects of model misspecification on inference about population splits and gene flow from sequencing data. The authors focus on the case in which the inferential model assumes a single, discrete pulse of introgression, while the true (data-generating) model reflects continuous migration, a different direction or assignment of introgression, or gene flow from a non-sampled ghost population. The authors first review and derive analytical results for a sample of two haploid samples, one from each of two populations, under an asymptotic model that assumes an infinite number of freely recombining loci under the MSci and the isolation-with-migration (IM) model. Given likelihood functions for both models, the authors minimise the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two functions with respect to the data-generating model, and thus obtain the *pseudo-true parameter values* under the MSci model. The authors extend this framework to the cases in which the data-generating model is the isolation-with-initial migration (IIM) or the secondary-contact (SC) model of of gene flow. To establish a correspondence between the probability of introgression in the MSci model and the rates and times of gene flow under the continuous-migration models (IM, IIM, SC), the authors focus on the probability that any migration occurs in the latter models. The authors complement their analytical theory with simulations to extend the scope of the asymptotic theory and cover more complex demographic histories. In general, the authors find that species divergence times and effective sizes of recent populations are well estimated under the misspecified model if gene flow is not too high. However, estimates of introgression times under the MSci model are biased towards the more recent end of respective periods of continuous gene flow in the data-generating models. Assignment of introgression events to wrong branches resulted in estimates of introgression times collapsing with population divergence times, and underestimation of introgression probabilities. The authors found that including more and longer loci, and more sequences per population tended to provide more precise, but not necessarily more accurate, parameter estimates.

I have no doubt that the authors address a so-far under-explored and under-appreciated issue in studies of speciation and population differentiation. Once published, the paper will likely trigger further theoretical studies, but also direct empirical studies on divergence with gene flow and help interpreting the results thereof. In regard of this latter, empirical perspective, a strength of the manuscript is that it explores the effects of the number of loci, the length of these loci, and of including more than one sequence per locus from each population. Topic and scope of the manuscript nicely fit in the realm of Molecular Biology and Evolution. However, the manuscript still suffers from a number of points detailed below, which include its length, an uncertainty about the correctness of a key analytical quantity, notational and structural issues, and a lack of clarity about which analytical results are new as opposed to restated from previous literature. I am aware of the fact that some issues I raised below might have been introduced by the authors in response to earlier reviews. Some of my suggestions might thus conflict with earlier reviewers' requests. An editorial decision may need to be taken in such cases.

## Major concerns

1. I understood that the main focus of the manuscript is on assessing the impact of model misspecification on estimates of population divergence times, the timing and amount of gene flow, and effective population sizes. The authors did well in establishing this story line in the Introduction. However, and somewhat oddly, the Introduction also contains a mini review of methods for inference of gene flow from multilocus sequence data (from line 97 to line 159). This part reviews summary (approximate) approaches to full likelihood approaches of inference, which is a topic at most tangential, if not orthogonal, to the paper's main story. In addition, such a mini review runs the risk of being incomplete; the authors seem to ignore, for instance, Approximate Bayesian Computation, to which some of the limitations that the authors assign to approximate methods may apply to a much lesser extent. I suggest that the Introduction be streamlined to only cover the parts most relevant to the paper's story, which is assessing the effect of model misspecification.
2. In sub-subsection "Asymptotic theory" of the Results, the authors introduce analytical results leading to likelihood functions under the MSci and continuous-migration models (IM, IIM, SC). However, it is currently not clear enough which of the results presented are novel and which ones were obtained by previous authors. Without checking in detail, but based on my recollection of earlier relevant literature, I feel that all the results presented for the IM, IIM, and SC model were obtained before collectively by Wilkinson-Herbots (2008 Theor Popul Biol; 2021 Theor Popul Biol) and Costa and Wilkinson-Herbots (2017 Genetics; 2021 Theor Popul Biol). I think the authors should make more clear which results are novel, and provide references for result they restate from earlier literature.
3. [Uncertainty about correctness of Eq. (10), which to my understanding incorrectly subsumes one to many migration events, as opposed to just a single one. As a consequence, Eq. (10) would seem to predict too high a value of $\phi_0$. This deviation may contribute to the apparent underestimation of $\phi_0$ in most of the comparisons of simulated data and analytical predictions.] TODO(Simon): Go on here.
4. Unusual beginning of Discussion with a detailed and excessively long paragraph comparing the current study to a previous one. This paragraph seems to have been introduced in response to a claim by a previous reviewer, but it is oddly placed. It distracts from the main findings of the paper that should be restated and interpreted first.
5. The notation notation should be improved throughout the manuscript to clearly differentiate between parameters and their values, as opposed to their estimators and estimates.
6. I found the abbreviation "MSci" for "MSC-with-introgression" (where MSC represents "multi-species coalescent") inappropriate, as it is unintuitive (It is tempting to deduce "continuous introgression/immigration" from "ci") and it runs against the apparent logic according to which the abbreviations for other models treated in the manuscript were formed. I appreciate that "MSci" was already used as an abbreviation for MSC-with-introgression by Flouri et al. (2020). However, I think it is still early enough to make a change to the better â€“ or, actually, stick to "MSNC" as previously used by Wen and Nakleh (2018) and Zhang et al. (2018).
7. It remained unclear to me if BPP only uses information from all possible inter-population pairs of sequences, or if within-population pairs of sequences are also used. I understand that the analytical theory in the current manuscript only covers the case of a single sequence from each of two populations, and the probability of the data is computed only for an inter-population pair of sequences. Even after consulting Flouri et al. (2018, 2020), it was not entirely clear if to me if BPP, in contrast to the analytical theory, also considers within-population pairs of sequences. I suggest the authors explicitly state what information BPP uses from the data.
8. The manuscript seems too long and I think this is primarily due to issues 1 (overloaded Introduction) and 2 (oddly placed and overly detailed first paragraph of the Discussion), but also due to excessively detailed language in the Results section. I strongly suggest the authors make an effort to reduce the length of the manuscript by about 20%.
9. The supplementary figures were provided mixed with source and style files, and I could not find any caption texts to the supplementary figures. I thus had to search for the relevant files and relate them to the references from the main text. I also cannot provide a complete review, because the caption texts were missing.
