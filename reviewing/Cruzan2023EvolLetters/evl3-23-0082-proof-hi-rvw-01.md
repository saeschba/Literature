## Summary
In this manuscript, Cruzan aims to find a mechanistic explanation for the arguably accumulating evidence of rapid (adaptive) evolution following population bottlenecks. To this aim, the author sets out to test if genetic drift can "facilitate" selection in "small" populations by means of simulation and comparison of these to existing theoretical predictions based on the diffusion approximation. Cruzan claims to find evidence for "drift facilitation" in terms of increased changes in the frequency of weakly beneficial, initially rare, alleles in small ($N < 100$) populations. He further interprets quantitative differences between simulated fixation times and those predicted by the diffusion approximation as qualitative evidence suggesting that genetic drift accelerates adaptive evolution in small, and decelerates it in large, populations. This interpretation implies that the diffusion approximation fails to appropriately capture the interaction between genetic drift and selection beyond quantitative approximation errors. Cruzan also simulates what he calls "fixation flux" – or what is more commonly known as the rate of substitution – of beneficial mutations to apparently find that this rate declines with increasing population size. Even though this observation seems to be a consequence of too short a simulation time, the author interprets the finding as evidence for selection to be less effective in fixing beneficial mutations in large compared to small populations – and thus large populations to be more liable to segregation load compared to smaller ones. Cruzan's dissection of genetic load into drift load and segregation load as a function of population size is an interesting one, but the conclusion that differences in these types of load between small and large populations explain rapid adaptation following population bottlenecks remains little more than a speculation given the narrow scope of the simulations performed.

I am afraid that the manuscript is unclear with respect to fundamental points, such as what exactly is to be understood by "small" (and "intermediate") population size, what exactly is meant by "drift facilitation", and why the author is challenging the diffusion approximation when the analyses he performs are – by their design – not capable of proofing its qualitative "wrongness".

Moreover, the effects on simulation outcomes of implementation choices such as the distribution of selection coefficients or the way in which an individual's fitness arises from fitness functions at individual loci on simulations remain unclear.

I have also read the reviews of three previous reviewers and the response to these by the author. I share all concerns that reviewer 1 had, and I am not going to repeat these concerns.

Overall, I think this manuscript suffers from too many conceptual issues and makes claims that the analyses do not back for it to be published in Evolution Letters.
