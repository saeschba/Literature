## Summary and recommendation
In this manuscript, Cruzan aims to find a mechanistic explanation for empirical evidence of rapid (adaptive) evolution after population bottlenecks and founder events. The author sets out to test if genetic drift can "facilitate" selection in "small" populations by means of simulation and comparison of these to existing theoretical predictions based on the diffusion approximation. Cruzan claims to find evidence for "drift facilitation" in terms of increased changes in the frequency of weakly beneficial, initially rare, alleles in small (here: $N < 100$) populations. He further interprets quantitative differences between simulated fixation times and those predicted by the diffusion approximation as qualitative evidence that genetic drift accelerates (decelerates) adaptive evolution in small (large) populations. This interpretation implies that the diffusion approximation fails to capture the interaction between genetic drift and selection beyond quantitative approximation errors. Cruzan also simulates what he calls "fixation flux" – or what is more commonly known as the rate of substitution – of beneficial mutations to apparently find that this rate declines with increasing population size. Even though the authors seems to acknowledge that this finding is affected by too short a simulation time, he concludes that the substitution rate of beneficial mutations is lower in large than small populations – and thus that large populations are more prone to accumulating segregation load compared to smaller ones. Cruzan's dissection of genetic load into drift load and segregation load as a function of population size is an interesting one, but the conclusion that differences in these types of load between small and large populations explain rapid adaptation following population bottlenecks remains little more than a speculation given the narrow scope of the simulations performed.

I am afraid that the manuscript is unclear with respect to fundamental points, including what exactly is to be understood by "small" (and "intermediate") population size, what exactly is meant by "drift facilitation" and how it should be measured properly, and why the author is challenging the diffusion approximation when the analyses he performs are – by their design – not capable of proofing its qualitative "wrongness".

Moreover, the effects on simulation outcomes of implementation choices such as the distribution of selection coefficients or the way in which an individual's fitness arises from fitness functions at individual loci on simulations remain unclear.

I have also read the reviews of three previous reviewers and the response to these by the author. Reviewer 1 raised substantial concerns based on their expert background in theoretical results by Wright, Haldane, Kimura and Ohta relevant to the scope of Cruzan's manuscript. I share these concerns, I think they are substantial. I am not going to repeat them, even though I do not think they have been satisfyingly attenuated by the author's response to them.

Overall, I think this manuscript suffers from too many conceptual issues and makes claims not backed by the analyses. Fixing this shortcoming would take substantial conceptual redesign, an extension in the scope of simulations, and a thorough comparison to theoretical results not yet integrated. I am afraid the only recommendation I can suggest is to reject the manuscript as it is.

## Major concerns

Even though written well overall, the manuscript suffers from a lack of clarity about fundamental points:
1. The author at times refers to "small" populations (e.g. l.45), "intermediate" populations (e.g. l.297), or "intermediate sizes (small)" populations (l.97) as the populations of interest. I acknowledge that some of this terminological inconsistency follows from what Wright, Simpson and the author himself deem to be the size range of interest. However, or even more so, it would seem important to clearly delineate which range of population sizes is of interest to the author.
2. A related issue is that population size can be defined in absolute terms (no. of individuals $N$) or relative to the strength of evolutionary processes (e.g. relative to the selection coefficient [$1/(4s)$] or the mutation rate [$1/(4u)$]). An intricate problem here is that Wright, Kimura, Ohta, Ewens and others would tend to use the relative definition, acknowledging the fundamental result from the diffusion approximation that it is the compound parameters (e.g. $Ns$, $Nu$, ...) that determine the dynamics and equilibria of allele frequencies. The author, however, seems to be making the case that this "diffusion view" fails to capture a fundamental and qualitative aspect of how drift ($N$) interacts with selection ($s$) beyond $Ns$. For that reason, the author must is bound to using the absolute definition, but this requires a "translation" to the relative definition at times when it comes to comparing his claims to the theoretical predictions based on the diffusion approximation. This issue leads to a confusion that hampers both reading flow and comprehension of the manuscript.
3. It remains unclear what exactly the author means by "drift facilitation" and thus how it **should be measured. ...**

More fundamentally, I struggled with conceptual problems relating to the aim of the manuscript, an apparent mismatch between the aim and the analyses performed, and a lack of substantiated evidence for some of the claims made. Specifically:

4. I am concerned about a major mismatch between the overarching aim of the manuscript – to understand why rapid adaptation sometimes occurs after a founder event involving a bottleneck and/or a change in selective environment – and the narrow scope of the simulations of just a single population of constant size without bottleneck, change in selective environment, and pre-history determining the amount and nature of standing genetic variation. In short, the analyses do not cover the full domain of the objectives.
5. Even though the author states multiple times that his main aim is to understand rapid adaptive evolution after a founder event in a new environment, the manuscript also seems to be geared at more generally challenging the qualitative "correctness" of the diffusion approximation to the probability and time of fixation of beneficial and deleterious mutations, and downstream results on the substitution rate and the amount and nature of genetic load in finite populations. I understand that if the diffusion approximation failed to capture a qualitatively important effect of drift on selection, this would have implications on adaptive adaptation after founder events and likely well beyond. However, turning the tables, there are many more alternative explanations for why adaptive evolution can sometimes be fast after a founder event, **including ..., ..., or ...** It is not immediately clear why the author selects the "drift facilitation" explanation and masks out the others.
6. Beyond the lack of clarity associated with the term "drift facilitation", there is the issue of how it should be measured. Intuition would say it should be measured relative to one of two extremes, namely i) neutrality in a finite population or ii) adaptation in an infinitely large population. Results are currently shown on a scale that makes their interpretation **difficult. ... Moreover,** if the aim really were to challenge the diffusion approximation, this would require much more extensive simulations capturing a wide combination of values of $s$ and $N$ over a range of values of the compound parameter $Ns$, as well as a well-chosen metric or measure of accuracy. However, going down this road would seem to be a questionable strategy for a paper given the extensive amount of previous work investigating the accuracy of the diffusion approximation and the results coming out of this work (cf. comments by reviewer 1 in the first round of reviews).

## Minor comments
**C:** comment; **Q:** question; **S:** suggestion; **R:** request.

Given the weight of the concerns stated above and stated before by some of the other reviewers, I am not going to provide an extensive list of minor issues, and I am refraining completely from listing typos and comments on word choice and alike. Here is just a selection of the most important minor issues:

- Multi-locus fitness
- Lack of derivation (references) supporting $\bar{w}$
- Effect of distribution of $s$ (here: Poisson) on the results. Illustrate via numerical integration of the diffusion approximation.
