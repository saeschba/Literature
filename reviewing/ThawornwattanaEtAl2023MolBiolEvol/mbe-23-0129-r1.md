## Summary


## Major concerns

1. ...
2. In the application to the *Heliconius* data, the differences between coding and noncoding DNA in the estimates of the mutation-scaled split times and population sizes are striking (see Figure S7). The difference is particularly large for the time to the root, $\tau_r$, with estimates for noncoding DNA generally at least two-fold higher than estimates for coding DNA. The authors explain this difference by a reduced (effective) neutral mutation rate in coding regions due to purifying selection. Can the authors verify this explanation by comparing the differences in respective parameters between coding and noncoding DNA found in previous studies of the same two focal *Heliconius* species?
3. In the application to the *Heliconius* data, estimates ...
