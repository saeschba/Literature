# Review of Manuscript TPB-D-22-00016 by Simon Aeschbacher

## Summary

Abbreviations to be introduced:
- site-frequency spectrum (SFS)

## Major comments

1. The distinction between "time-averaged SFS" and "equilibrium SFS" could be made more clear. I suggest the authors be more explicit about the contexts they refer to when they use these two terms. The reason is that the manuscript considers a range of scenarios in which at least one aspect of the environment (selection or demography) is dynamic, and thus in which "time-averaged" makes sense. On the other hand, "equilibrium" may refer to the fully constant scenario (constant population size, constant selection), but technically also to an equilibrium of a fast process relative to a slow process in those cases where a separation of time scales is assumed. For specific cases, see "Minor comments" below.

## Minor comments

I use the following abbreviations to qualify my comments:
- **C:** Comment
- **Q:** Question
- **R:** Requested change
- **S:** Suggestion

### Abstract
- l.6: **S:** Split a long sentence: "...theory approach, and derive..." --> "...theory approach. We derive..."
- l.8–10: **C:** This sentence is not entirely clear, partially because the context to which "equilibrium SFS" refers to is not explicitly given. The reader might misinterpret the context as "when the population experiences both positive and negative cycles of the selection coefficient", but the quoted part does not describe the context under which the equilibrium exists, but the condition under which there is a significant difference to the time-averaged SFS. Clarity in this sentence seems crucial, as it summarises the essence of the manuscript. **S:** If I understood correctly, it would be preferable to write "We show that, for strong selection and a slowly changing environment, and assuming that the population experiences both positive and negative cycles of the selection coefficient, the SFS differs significantly from the equilibrium SFS in a constant environment." Note: I suggest to omit "non(-)equilibrium" because even in a constant environment the SFS may deviate from the equilibrium SFS before the equilibrium is reached (e.g. after a perturbation). One might use "time-averaged" instead of "non-equilibrium", but doing so anticipates the specification of the focus of the paper given at the very end of the Introduction on page 5.

### 1 Introduction
Page 3
- l.17: **S:** "The above discussion assumes..." --> "The extensions of the classical results above assume..."
- l.19–20: **S:** To increase clarity: "...there is no stationary state and the nonequilibrium SFS can differ significantly from the equilibrium one..." --> "there is no stationary state and the time-averaged SFS in a changing environment can differ significantly from the equilibrium SFS in a constant environment".
- l.23: **R:** Insert "a" after "while"; "low frequency" --> "low-frequency".

Page 4
- l.19: **R:**: "...time scales also for which different..." --> "...time scales also, for which different..."
- l.23: **S:** To improve the transition and be more explicit about the gap of knowledge addressed: "Motivated by the above discussion, here we..." --> "To better understand the dynamics of the SFS in populations of varying size and in changing environments, here we..."

Page 5
- l.4: **S:** To increase clarity: "...how the time-averaged SFS deviates from the equilibrium SFS" --> "...how the time-averaged SFS in a changing environment deviates from the equilibrium SFS in a constant environment".

### 2 Model

Page 6
- l.9–10: **C/Q:** This last part of the sentence could be understood as saying that the condition $0 \le \nu \lt 1$ ensures deterministic dynamics. I do not see how this is the case, but I might be missing something. I suggest the authors double-check the formulation.
